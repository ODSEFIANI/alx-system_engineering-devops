**Postmortem: Web Stack Outage Incident**

**Issue Summary:**
- **Duration:** 2 hours, from 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM (UTC)
- **Impact:**
  - **Service Affected:** Database connectivity for the web application
  - **User Experience:** 50% of users experienced errors while trying to fetch or submit data.

**Root Cause:**
The outage resulted from a missing dependency—specifically, the required database driver was playing hide-and-seek, causing the web application to throw a tantrum instead of connecting to the database.

**Timeline:**
- **3:00 PM:** Distress signals detected as users reported errors and the system responded with more confusion than a cat in a room full of laser pointers.
- **3:15 PM:** Initial investigation, armed with a magnifying glass and a Sherlock hat, focused on the application code, suspecting a bug or misconfiguration plotting mischief.
- **3:45 PM:** Discovered the missing actor in our drama—SQLAlchemy, the database driver—hiding backstage during a thorough review of the server environment.
- **4:00 PM:** Incident escalated to the development team, who bravely faced the missing SQLAlchemy and convinced it to come out of hiding.
- **5:00 PM:** Issue resolved, and SQLAlchemy reinstated as the lead actor in our database connectivity drama.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**
- **Root Cause:** SQLAlchemy, the elusive database driver, was found hiding in the attic of our server, causing the web application to refuse to talk to the database.
- **Resolution:** Our developers, armed with charm and a stern talking-to, convinced SQLAlchemy to come back to the stage. The missing package was promptly installed using the appropriate package manager, ending the dramatic standoff.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**
- **Things to Improve/Fix:**
  - **Dependency Management:** Implementing a checklist to ensure all required dependencies, such as the elusive SQLAlchemy, are not playing hide-and-seek but are explicitly documented and installed.
  - **Documentation Review:** Regularly reviewing and updating documentation to include detailed setup instructions, complete with an encouragement note for dependencies to come out of hiding.

- **Tasks to Address the Issue:**
  1. **Dependency Checklist:** A comprehensive list to ensure all necessary dependencies are present, preventing any more disappearing acts.
  2. **Automated Dependency Checks:** Introducing automated checks in the deployment pipeline to track down any rogue dependencies trying to escape.
  3. **Documentation Update:** Enhancing documentation with a troubleshooting section that includes a map to find and coax reluctant dependencies into cooperating.
  4. **Training:** Providing training for developers on how to talk to their dependencies—apparently, they respond better to kind words and chocolate.
  5. **Monitoring:** Setting up monitoring alerts with personalized messages to dependencies, reminding them of their importance and discouraging any further attempts to ghost us.

**Conclusion:**
In the grand theatre of web applications, our missing SQLAlchemy briefly stole the spotlight, causing chaos akin to a Shakespearean tragedy. Through wit, charm, and a bit of coaxing, we successfully brought the missing actor back on stage, resolving the issue and preventing future disappearances. With improved checklists, automated dependency detectives, and a touch of charm in our documentation, we aim to keep our web stack drama-free and our audiences happily engaged. Remember, even in the world of tech, a little humor can go a long way in making the show memorable!
